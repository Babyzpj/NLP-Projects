# Introduction
**Named entity recognition (NER)**, **Part-of-Speeching tagging (POS)** and **Chinese word segmentation** are tasks of **sequence labeling**. Without deep learning, statistical **linear-chain conditional random fields (linear-chain CRF)** is the favorable solution. But it requires hand-crafted features. In deep learning fields, bi-directional LSTM + CRF gives the state-of-the-art performance, which is discussed in detail here.
